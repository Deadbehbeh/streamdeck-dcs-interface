    <h1 id="description-of-streamdeck-button-settings">Description of Streamdeck Button Settings</h1>
    <p>In order to use the DCS Interface buttons on Streamdeck you must use ID values that the aircraft modules use
        internally via their .lua scripts.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="dcs-command-on-button-press-settings">DCS Command (on Button Press) Settings</h2>
    <p>These set what will be commanded to DCS when you physically press the StreamDeck button.</p>
    <p><strong>Button ID</strong> -- The Button ID is a number associated with the specific clickabledata item (button,
        switch, dial, lever) you would like to command.</p>
    <p><strong>Device ID</strong> -- The Device ID is a number representing different categorizations of clickable items
        in the cockpit. The definition of the number is defined in:</p>
    <p>The remaining settings differ according to what type of DCS Interface button is used and can be categorized into
        Momentary, Increment, and Switch.</p>
    <h3 id="momentary-button-settings">Momentary Button settings</h3>
    <p>The momentary buttons are used to send commands to clickabledata items of BTN type, or LEV type in special cases,
        see note below.</p>
    <p><strong>Send Value while Pressed</strong> -- This is the value that is sent immediately upon pressing the
        Streamdeck button. By default most buttons will use <code>1</code> for a pressed value. Sometimes pairs of
        buttons (such as up/down arrow buttons on a panel) will have <code>1</code> as the pressed value for the up
        arrow button, and <code>-1</code> as the value for the down arrow button, even though they are independent
        buttons.</p>
    <p><strong>Send Value while Released</strong> -- This is the value that is sent after releasing the Streamdeck
        button. For most momentary buttons (such as a numeric UFC button) will remain pressed until they are sent an off
        value, (by default) <code>0</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Disable (Send Release) Check</strong> -- The checkbox next to the &quot;Send Value while Released&quot;
        will disable any command being sent when releasing a button.</p>
    <p><em>Note: Repetition of sent value while button is held pressed is not supported at this time.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Use with Axis (LEV) Type</strong> -- Some of the volume knobs and comms channel selectors are designed to
        accept axis input, and they expect a single value to increment their value. For example a volume knob with
        limits 0,1 can be rotated with small rotations by setting &quot;Send Value while Pressed&quot; to
        <code>0.01</code> and disabling the release value (as the release value will just interfere). To rotate a
        greater amount per press, increase the send value.</p>
    <h3 id="increment-settings">Increment Settings</h3>
    <p>Increment buttons are used for clickabledata items of TUMB type, which are rotary dials or other items that have
        multiple values you want to iterate through.</p>
    <p><strong>DCS ID</strong> -- This is the ID of the clickabledata item's value you want to increment. This is
        separate from the Button ID, and provides information on the DCS simulation state of the item. The value is used
        to increment from the simulation state value so button presses don't get out of sync with the game and dials can
        be rotated by either clicking in the cockpit or using the Streamdeck button.</p>
    <p><strong>Increment by Value</strong> -- This is the amount you would like to increment by. A common value used by
        most rotary switches in the game is <code>0.1</code> where a positive value rotates in the clock-wise direction
        and a negative value, <code>-0.1</code>, will rotate counter-clock-wise. Increasing this value will allow larger
        increments per button press.</p>
    <p><strong>Increment range min/max</strong> -- These values represent the range limits for the clickabledata item.
        By default this will limit inputs from the &quot;Increment by Value&quot; such that the min/max is not exceeded.
        Generally the range is often <code>[0,1]</code>, but for rotary selector switches with discrete values (such as
        L/R/BOTH) it is common to set each of those settings to a 0.1 multiple and adjust the range accordingly. So a
        switch with three options would have a range <code>[0.0,2.0]</code> where <code>(0.0, 0.1, 0.2)</code> would
        correspond to the three options. Similarly, items with an implied direction may have a negative component with a
        range like <code>[-0.1,0.1]</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Allow cycling to beginning</strong> -- This checkbox when checked allows an increment to cycle back to
        the beginning of a range. If the increment is positive, exceeding the max value would reset the value to the
        min, and vice versa for a negative increment.</p>
    <h3 id="switch-settings">Switch Settings</h3>
    <p>The switch can also be used with clickabledata items of TUMB type, but is used in the case where there are two
        values you want to switch between and uses the Streamdeck image state to manage its state.</p>
    <p><img src="file:///c:\code\streamdeck-dcs-interface\Sources\com.ctytler.dcs.sdPlugin\helpDocs\switch_states.png"
            alt="Switch States" title="Switch States"></p>
    <p><strong>Send Value for 1st-&gt;2nd State</strong> -- This is the value sent when the Streamdeck button is in the
        1st state and you want to transition to the 2nd state. The Streamdeck button image state will only change if the
        DCS simulation DCS ID which the image is monitoring changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Send Value for 2nd-&gt;1st State</strong> -- This is the value sent when the Streamdeck button is in the
        2nd state and you want to transition back to the 1st state.</p>
    <p>Switch commands must be used in conjunction with the &quot;Image State Change on DCS Update Settings&quot; to
        actuate the switch state. See section below for details.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="image-state-change-on-dcs-update-settings">Image State Change on DCS Update Settings</h2>
    <p>These settings will monitor the DCS game and change the image of the Streamdeck button when conditions are met.
    </p>
    <p><img src="file:///c:\code\streamdeck-dcs-interface\Sources\com.ctytler.dcs.sdPlugin\helpDocs\change_button_image.png"
            alt="Change Button State" title="Change Button Image (State)"></p>
    <p><strong>DCS ID</strong> -- This field is set to the numeric value of the DCS function you would like to monitor.
        For switches or physical button states the DCS ID from the ID Lookup table can be used here, but lamps and other
        indicator values will need to be looked up externally.</p>
    <p>As this Streamdeck plugin relies on the <strong>DCS-ExportScript</strong> project for communication with the
        game, I recommend finding lamp and indicator values directly from their curated export scripts - <a
            href="https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts/tree/master/Scripts/DCS-ExportScript/ExportsModules">GitHub
            Link</a>.</p>
    <p>For example the AV8B Harrier A/G Mode indicator lamp has a DCS ID of <code>281</code> as seen from the comments
        (anything prepended with &quot;--&quot;) in the following excerpt of <strong>DCS-ExportScript</strong>'s
        <code>AV8BNA.lua</code> file:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>    --MIP OUTER LEFT SIDE
    [283] = &quot;%.f&quot;, --NAV
    [285] = &quot;%.f&quot;, --VSTOL
    [281] = &quot;%.f&quot;, --A/G
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p><strong>Show 2nd State Image When</strong> -- This setting is a selection of how you would like to evaluate the
        received state of the function (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>==</code>, or <code>&gt;</code>). If the evaluation is
        <code>True</code>, then the state of the button will be set to the 2nd state (the illuminated button if looking
        at the above image).</p>
    <p>Example: <code>DCS ID = 281, Show When = &quot;&gt;&quot;, Value = 0.0</code><br>
        For these settings the second state of the button will be activated (showing the second image) if the A/G Mode
        lamp function returns a value of <code>1.0</code>, and will reset to the first state if it drops back to
        <code>0.0</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Value</strong> -- This is the value of the condition evaluated with either <code>&lt;</code>,
        <code>==</code>, or <code>&gt;</code>. This is generally a numeric value.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="title-text-change-on-dcs-update-settings">Title Text Change on DCS Update Settings</h2>
    <p>This section is to monitor the same type of DCS functions as the &quot;Image State Change&quot; section above,
        but instead of changing the Streamdeck button image it will set the button's Title text. Examples of where this
        would be useful is for Aircraft Scratchpads and UFC Text Displays, and with additional configuration rotary
        switch selected values.</p>
    <p><strong>DCS ID</strong> -- This field is set to the numeric value of the DCS function you would like to monitor.
        ID values here can be determined here in the same manner as done for the &quot;Image State Change&quot; as
        described above.</p>
    <p>For example, with the <code>AV8BNA.lua</code> export script, setting a DCS ID equal to <code>250</code> would
        display the text for the ODU Option1 panel.</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>    -- ODU Panel
    [250] = &quot;%1d&quot;, --ODU Option1
    [251] = &quot;%1d&quot;, --ODU Option2
    [252] = &quot;%1d&quot;, --ODU Option3
    [248] = &quot;%1d&quot;, --ODU Option4
    [249] = &quot;%1d&quot;, --ODU Option5
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p><strong>Vertical Spacing</strong> -- This provides an option for shifting the displayed text up (positive values)
        or down (negative values) a number of lines. By default this is set to 0. This can be used in combination with
        the Vertical Alignment settings in the Streamdeck Title settings (i.e. shift up or down from Center alignment,
        or shift down from Top alignment).</p>
    <p><strong>Display string unaltered</strong> -- By default this is checked and will set the title text to exactly
        what is received for the monitored DCS ID. This is desired for handling functions with text values, such as the
        ODU text display panel used in the example above. If this is unchecked an additional settings textbox is
        provided, &quot;Map Value to Display Text.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>Map Value to Display Text</strong> -- This box allows mapping numeric values received from the simulation
        to displayed text. An example use case is for showing the selection of a rotary switch. For example the F-5E
        module has an &quot;External Stores Selector&quot; dial which selects between (RIPL,BOMBS,SAFE,RKT/DISP) using
        internal values of (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3). Monitoring the DCS ID for this clickabledata item will return the
        numeric value. If you would like to display the text equivalents of those values you can uncheck &quot;Display
        string unaltered&quot; and in the map value textbox enter (without spaces):</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>0.0=RIPL,0.1=BOMBS,0.2=SAFE,0.3=RKT/DISP
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p><strong>Text/Font Settings</strong> -- The font, size, vertical alignment, and color of the text can be set with
        the Streamdeck Title (T) settings.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The &quot;Title&quot; field must be left empty in the Streamdeck settings for this to
        work.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1 id="id-lookup-window">ID Lookup Window</h1>
    <h2 id="setup-required---dcs-install-directory">Setup Required - DCS Install Directory</h2>
    <p>The ID lookup uses a lua script to extract clickabledata item attributes from the modules in the DCS World
        installation. Therefore, the directory where DCS World is installed must be entered correctly in the textbox -
        use the &quot;Update&quot; button to save changes.</p>
    <p>If the directory is not specified correctly the &quot;Select Module&quot; drop-down will be blank. When the
        install directory is found, modules installed within <code>&lt;DCS World install dir&gt;\mods\aircraft\</code>
        directory will be included in the Select Module list.</p>
    <h2 id="aircraft-module-clickabledata">Aircraft Module Clickabledata</h2>
    <p>When a module is selected from the drop-down list the table of clickabledata will be populated. Each row
        represents a registered &quot;clickable&quot; cockpit item in the game. Some elements have more than one row,
        this often corresponds to the different actions taken for a mouse &quot;left-click&quot; and
        &quot;right-click&quot; on that item. For example, the &quot;Knob&quot; and &quot;Switch&quot; items below allow
        rotating clock-wise or counter-clock-wise, for the knob, or moving in the up or down directions, for the
        switches, so these have a row each with a positive and negative &quot;Click Value&quot;.</p>

        <em>Type</em> -- Type of the clickabledata item.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>BTN: A push-button, generally with an on/off value aligning with the Limit Min/Max (can be positive or
            negative).</li>
        <li>TUMB: A switch or dial with multiple values that can be assigned within the Limit Min/Max range.</li>
        <li>LEV: An axis-assignable item that can generally accept a value within a continuous range of the Limit
            Min/Max.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>DCS ID</em> -- The ID to monitor the value of the item, needed for Increment and Switch Streamdeck
        buttons.<br>
        <em>Click Value</em> -- The value sent for a left/right click of the mouse. May have different meaning according
        to Type:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>BTN: Click value is generally the &quot;pressed&quot; button value (usually 1).</li>
        <li>TUMB (Rotary Knobs): This is the value the knob will be incremented within the range (usually +/-0.1).</li>
        <li>TUMB (Switches): This is the value the switch will be incremented within the range on click (usually +/-1,
            but sometimes +/-0.1 also).</li>
        <li>LEV: Click value is the increment value within the range, however is often listed as 0 in the table. For
            these you will need to manually enter a Send value in Command settings that provides a desirable response.
            The momentary button with the &quot;Send on Release&quot; disabled is recommended for providing axis-like

        at the same time see <a href="#enabling-both-dcs-interface--ikarus">Enabling Both DCS Interface &amp;

    <h2 id="enabling-both-dcs-interface--ikarus">Enabling Both DCS Interface &amp; Ikarus</h2>
    <p>The default installation instructions suggest overriding the Ikarus port for simplicity and is designed for users
        not also using Ikarus.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/s-d-a/Ikarus">Ikarus</a> provides a virtual cockpit display that can display gauges,
        indicators, and switches that can be displayed in an independent window (or overlaid) from DCS. It also supports
        touch screen monitors.</p>
    <p>To enable use of both the IkarusPort settings should be kept at their default (1625), and a new block of config
        settings should be added so the file <code>DCS-ExportScript\Config.lua</code> contains:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>-- Ikarus a Glass Cockpit Software
ExportScript.Config.IkarusExport    = true         -- false for not use
ExportScript.Config.IkarusHost      = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;  -- IP for Ikarus
ExportScript.Config.IkarusPort      = 1625         -- Port Ikarus (1625)
ExportScript.Config.IkarusSeparator = &quot;:&quot;

-- Added for Streamdeck DCS Interface (IkarusExport must also be true)
ExportScript.Config.StreamdeckExport  = true         -- false for not use
ExportScript.Config.StreamdeckHost    = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;  -- IP for DCS Interface
ExportScript.Config.StreamdeckPort    = 1725         -- Port DCS Interface (1725)
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>Then within the <code>DCS-ExportScript\lib\Tools.lua</code> file, find the first line of the below section, and
        copy paste the &quot;Added section for DCS Interface&quot; block of code below it, so the file contains:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>        	try(ExportScript.UDPsender:sendto(lPacket, ExportScript.Config.IkarusHost, ExportScript.Config.IkarusPort))

        	-- Added section for DCS Interface ------------
        	if ExportScript.Config.StreamdeckExport then
        		try(ExportScript.UDPsender:sendto(lPacket, ExportScript.Config.StreamdeckHost, ExportScript.Config.StreamdeckPort))
        	end
        	-- End of Added Section -----------------------
</div></code></code></pre>
    <h2 id="manually-determining-clickabledata-attributes">Manually Determining Clickabledata Attributes</h2>
    <p>The clickabledata for each DCS module is extracted from the DCS installation and shown in the &quot;ID
        Lookup&quot; window. However, if there are problems or you'd like to look at the source of information for more
        details, here is a description of how to manually identify the values.</p>
    <h3 id="button-id">Button ID</h3>
    <p>The Button ID is referred to as a &quot;command&quot; in the module configuration and can be found in the file:
    </p>
    <p><code>Mods\aircraft\&lt;AC_NAME&gt;\Cockpit\[Scripts\]clickabledata.lua</code></p>
    <p>For example, within AV8BNA the A/G Master Mode button uses <code>msc_commands.AG_Selector</code> as its command:
    </p>
    <pre><code><code><div>elements[&quot;PTN_280&quot;] = default_button(_(&quot;AG Master Mode Selector&quot;),
    devices.MSC, msc_commands.AG_Selector, 280)
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>The details of the <code>default_button()</code> function parameters can be found within
        <code>clickable_defs.lua</code>. Within the file <code>command_defs.lua</code> in the same directory as the
        clickabledata lua script you'll find the following numeric definition of that command:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>-- AV-/B N/A Commands
start_command   = 3000

msc_commands =
{
	NAV_Selector          = start_command + 282;
	VSTOL_Selector        = start_command + 284;
	AG_Selector           = start_command + 280;
	Switch_SEAT_ADJ       = start_command + 502;
	Seat_SFTY_LVR		  = start_command + 800;
}
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>So from this it can be seen that AG_Selector has a Button ID of (3000 + 280) = <code>3280</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="device-id">Device ID</h3>
    <p>The Device ID is a number representing different categorizations of clickable items in the cockpit. The
        definition of the number is defined in:</p>
    <p><code>Mods\aircraft\&lt;AC_NAME&gt;\Cockpit\[Scripts\]devices.lua</code></p>
    <p>For the example of the A/G Master Mode button for AV8B above, the device is defined as
        <code>&quot;MSC&quot;</code>. You will need to then reference the <code>devices.lua</code> file to see that the
        Device ID number is <code>12</code> from this line:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>devices[&quot;MSC&quot;]     = counter() -- 12
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p><em>Note: The <code>&quot;--&quot;</code> indicate comments, the true value is defined by the number of
            <code>counter()</code> calls.</em></p>
    <h3 id="send-value-while-pressed">Send Value while Pressed</h3>
    <p>This value is sent for the Button ID when the Streamdeck button is pressed. For the example we have of our A/G
        Master Mode button we can see it is defined via the <code>default_button()</code> function.</p>
    <p>If we now look inside the <code>clickable_defs.lua</code> file we can see that the function is defined with the
        following inputs:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>function default_button(hint_,device_,command_,arg_,arg_val_,arg_lim_)

    local   arg_val_ = arg_val_ or 1
    local   arg_lim_ = arg_lim_ or {0,1}
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>The <code>arg_</code> input is what we already saw and named the Button ID, however this shows that when
        <code>arg_val_</code> and <code>arg_lim_</code> are not provided in the <code>default_button()</code> function
        they take on default values of <code>1</code> and <code>{0,1}</code>, respectively.</p>
    <p>The <code>arg_val_</code> is what we care about here as that is the value that is sent when the button is
        pressed.</p>
    <h3 id="send-value-while-released">Send Value while Released</h3>
    <p>This value is sent for the Button ID when the Streamdeck button is released.</p>
    <p>From the example above we can see the button also has <code>arg_lim_={0,1}</code>. This is the range of values
        possible. Since this is simply an on/off button the range implies that 0 should be sent when the button is
        released.</p>
    <h3 id="note-more-complex-send-values">NOTE: More Complex Send Values</h3>
    <p>For buttons that are not simple on/off, but perhaps 3-way toggle or rotary dials, the <code>arg_val_</code> and
        <code>arg_lim_</code> become more important. Let's take a 2-way momentary switch as an example with the
        following define in <code>clickabledata.lua</code>:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>elements[&quot;PTN_397&quot;] = default_2_way_spring_switch(_(&quot;Fuzing Control&quot;),
    devices.SMC, smc_commands.Switch_FUZE, 397)
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>This one again does not provide anything other than <code>arg_</code> (the Button ID) to the function. Looking at
        the definition for <code>default_2_way_spring_switch()</code> in <code>clickable_defs.lua</code> we see it
        returns (with <code>inversed</code> defaulted to <code>1.0</code>):</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>    arg 		= {arg_, arg_},
    arg_value	= {1.0*inversed, -1.0*inversed},
    arg_lim 	= {{0.0, 1.0}, {-1.0, 0.0}},
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>The fact that it has a set of two <code>arg_</code>'s means it actually has two buttons defined with the same
        Button ID of <code>397</code>. This means that if you want to send a command to press the Fuze switch up you
        would use the following settings:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>Button ID=397, Device ID=29, SendPressed=1.0, SendReleased=0.0
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>And to send a command for Fuze switch down on a button press:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>Button ID=397, Device ID=29, SendPressed=-1.0, SendReleased=0.0
</div></code></code></pre>
    <h3 id="dcs-id">DCS ID</h3>
    <p>The DCS ID refers to the indication of an element. For example a switch's position (up/middle/down) will be held
        in the value referenced by the DCS ID. Indicators and gauges also have their status extracted via DCS ID. In the
        lua scripts for the A-10C there is a good example of how these work with the Master Caution button/lamp.</p>
    <p>First, as we saw in the Button ID section above, we can look at <code>clickabledata.lua</code> and find the
        Button ID:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>elements[&quot;PNT-BTN-UFC-MASTWARN&quot;] = {class = {class_type.BTN}, hint = _(&quot;Master Caution Light&quot;), device = devices.SYS_CONTROLLER, action = {device_commands.Button_1}, stop_action = {device_commands.Button_1}, arg = {403}, arg_value = {1.0}, arg_lim = {{0.0, 1.0}}, use_release_message = {false} }
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>Evaluating this we find that <code>device_commands.Button_1</code> indicates a Button ID of <code>3001</code>.
        Also provided in the function parameters is <code>arg = {403}</code>. This is the DCS ID for the
        <strong>button</strong> -- meaning it provides information on whether the button is pressed (1) or not (0). The
        lamp for the Master Caution light is a separate DCS ID and this is found in a separate file:</p>
    <p><code>Mods\aircraft\&lt;AC_NAME&gt;\Cockpit\[Scripts\]mainpanel_init.lua</code></p>
    <p>where it has the line:</p>
    <pre><code><code><div>caution_lamp(404,SystemsSignals.flag_MASTER_WARNING_STUB)	-- MASTER WARNING
</div></code></code></pre>
    <p>This gives us the DCS ID for the lamp indication of <code>404</code>. The A-10C module seems to have many of its
        lamp DCS ID values one value away from its button DCS ID values (403) in this case, which can be helpful if
        trying to discern these by trial and error.</p>
    <h3 id="note-more-complex-dcs-id-locations">NOTE: More Complex DCS ID Locations</h3>
    <p>The above example had the DCS ID conveniently defined within <code>mainpanel_init.lua</code>, however they may be
        defined within devices referenced by the mainpanel script. Or need experimentation to identify, possibly with
        the help of ModelExplorer.</p>
